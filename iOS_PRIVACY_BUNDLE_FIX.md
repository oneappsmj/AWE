# iOS Privacy Bundle Fix

## Problem Description

Since iOS 17 and newer, Flutter plugins require privacy manifests. Several plugins in our app don't provide proper privacy bundles, causing build failures with errors like:

```
Build input file cannot be found: '.../video_player_avfoundation_privacy.bundle/video_player_avfoundation_privacy'
```

## Comprehensive Solution

We've implemented multiple layers of fixes to ensure that privacy bundles are available for all problematic plugins:

### 1. Podfile Configuration

The Podfile has been modified to disable privacy manifest requirements for problematic plugins:

```ruby
plugins_with_privacy_issues = [
  'sqflite_darwin',
  'share_plus',
  'shared_preferences_foundation',
  'video_player_avfoundation',
  'path_provider_foundation',
  'flutter_secure_storage'
]

if plugins_with_privacy_issues.include?(target.name)
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    # Disable privacy manifest requirement for problematic plugins
    config.build_settings['PRIVACY_MANIFEST_REQUIRED'] = 'NO'
    config.build_settings['CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED'] = 'NO'
    config.build_settings['ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING'] = 'NO'

    # Remove privacy bundle reference
    if config.build_settings.key?('PRIVACY_MANIFEST_BUNDLE')
      config.build_settings.delete('PRIVACY_MANIFEST_BUNDLE')
    end
  end
end
```

### 2. Pre-build Privacy Bundle Creation

Our iOS pre-build script (`ios_prebuild.sh`) creates empty privacy bundles during the Xcode build process:

```bash
# Create empty privacy bundles for each plugin
for PLUGIN in "${PLUGINS_WITH_PRIVACY_ISSUES[@]}"; do
  echo "Creating privacy bundle for $PLUGIN"

  # Create directory for the privacy bundle
  mkdir -p "${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${PLUGIN}/${PLUGIN}_privacy.bundle"

  # Create empty file inside bundle
  touch "${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${PLUGIN}/${PLUGIN}_privacy.bundle/${PLUGIN}_privacy"
done
```

### 3. Runtime Privacy Bundle Creation

The `AppDelegate.swift` file creates privacy bundles at runtime if they're missing:

```swift
// This function creates privacy bundles at runtime if they don't exist
private func ensurePrivacyBundles() {
    // First try with the PathProviderPlugin helper
    PathProviderPlugin.createPrivacyBundleIfNeeded()

    // Then create for all other plugins
    if let bundleURL = Bundle.main.bundleURL {
        for plugin in pluginsWithPrivacyIssues {
            let privacyBundleDir = bundleURL.appendingPathComponent("\(plugin)_privacy.bundle")

            // Create directory if it doesn't exist
            if !FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: privacyBundleDir.path) {
                do {
                    try FileManager.default.createDirectory(at: privacyBundleDir, withIntermediateDirectories: true)

                    // Create empty file inside
                    let emptyFilePath = privacyBundleDir.appendingPathComponent("\(plugin)_privacy")
                    FileManager.default.createFile(atPath: emptyFilePath.path, contents: nil)
                    print("[SUCCESS] Created privacy bundle for \(plugin) at runtime")
                } catch {
                    print("[WARNING] Failed to create privacy bundle for \(plugin): \(error)")
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Create bundles in alternate locations as fallback
    let bundlePaths = [
        Bundle.main.bundlePath,
        NSHomeDirectory() + "/Library/Bundles",
        FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory.path
    ]

    for basePath in bundlePaths {
        createPrivacyBundle(basePath: basePath, pluginName: "video_player_avfoundation")
    }
}
```

### 4. CI Build Privacy Bundle Creation

The CI workflow creates privacy bundles in multiple locations before and after the build:

```yaml
- name: Create empty privacy bundles for Debug and Release builds
  run: |
    # Create bundles in the expected build location
    mkdir -p build/ios/Release-iphoneos/video_player_avfoundation/video_player_avfoundation_privacy.bundle
    touch build/ios/Release-iphoneos/video_player_avfoundation/video_player_avfoundation_privacy.bundle/video_player_avfoundation_privacy

    # Create bundles in the app bundle directory
    mkdir -p ios/Flutter/Release/Runner.app/video_player_avfoundation_privacy.bundle
    touch ios/Flutter/Release/Runner.app/video_player_avfoundation_privacy.bundle/video_player_avfoundation_privacy
```

### 5. Comprehensive Privacy Bundle Script

The `privacy_bundle_fix.sh` script provides a thorough solution that creates privacy bundles in all possible locations:

```bash
# Run this script before building:
./privacy_bundle_fix.sh
```

## Special Focus: video_player_avfoundation

For the `video_player_avfoundation` plugin specifically, we've added extra fallback mechanisms:

1. Special handling in the Podfile:

```ruby
if target.name == 'video_player_avfoundation'
  target.build_configurations.each do |config|
    # Ensure privacy bundle is included
    config.build_settings['CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED'] = 'NO'
    config.build_settings['ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING'] = 'NO'
  end
end
```

2. Symlinks creation in multiple locations
3. Direct bundle creation in the app's bundle directory
4. Fallback bundle creation in multiple system locations

## Implementation Details

This multi-layered approach ensures that even if one method fails, others will provide the necessary privacy bundles. The solution is designed to be robust against different build environments and Xcode versions.

## Root Cause

The issue happens because:

1. Flutter plugins like `sqflite_darwin`, `path_provider_foundation`, etc. reference privacy bundle files in their build settings
2. These files don't actually exist in the plugin, causing build failures
3. Apple requires these privacy manifests for App Store submissions

## Multiple Solutions

### Solution 1: Use the Privacy Bundle Fix Script

1. We've created a `privacy_bundle_fix.sh` script in the project root that:

   - Creates the necessary directories for all required privacy bundles
   - Adds empty placeholder files in these bundles

2. Run this script before building the app:
   ```bash
   chmod +x privacy_bundle_fix.sh
   ./privacy_bundle_fix.sh
   ```

### Solution 2: Configure Xcode Build Phase

1. In Xcode, open your project
2. Select the Runner target, go to "Build Phases"
3. Click "+" at the top and select "New Run Script Phase"
4. Move this new script phase before the "Thin Binary" phase
5. Add the following script content:

```bash
# iOS Pre-build script for privacy bundles
PLUGINS_WITH_PRIVACY_ISSUES=(
  "sqflite_darwin"
  "share_plus"
  "shared_preferences_foundation"
  "video_player_avfoundation"
  "path_provider_foundation"
  "flutter_secure_storage"
)

# Create empty privacy bundles for each plugin
for PLUGIN in "${PLUGINS_WITH_PRIVACY_ISSUES[@]}"; do
  echo "Creating privacy bundle for $PLUGIN"
  mkdir -p "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGIN}/${PLUGIN}_privacy.bundle"
  touch "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGIN}/${PLUGIN}_privacy.bundle/${PLUGIN}_privacy"
done
```

### Solution 3: Update Podfile Configuration

1. We've updated the `Podfile` with comprehensive fixes:

   - Disabled privacy manifest requirements globally
   - Added special handling for plugins with privacy issues
   - Fixed path_provider_foundation to prevent iOS 18.5 crashes

2. Key sections in the Podfile include:

   ```ruby
   # Disable privacy manifests globally for all targets
   config.build_settings['PRIVACY_MANIFEST_REQUIRED'] = 'NO'

   # Remove privacy bundle reference if it exists
   if config.build_settings.key?('PRIVACY_MANIFEST_BUNDLE')
     config.build_settings.delete('PRIVACY_MANIFEST_BUNDLE')
   end
   ```

## GitHub Actions / CI Build Fix

For CI environments, we've taken a multi-layered approach:

1. Updated the GitHub workflow to run the `privacy_bundle_fix.sh` script
2. Added a manual fallback to create the privacy bundles directly in the workflow
3. Added helpful error output if the build fails

## How to Use This Fix

1. Ensure your `pubspec.yaml` has all required dependencies
2. Make sure the `Podfile` contains the fixes described above
3. Run `flutter pub get` to update dependencies
4. Make `privacy_bundle_fix.sh` executable: `chmod +x privacy_bundle_fix.sh`
5. Run the script: `./privacy_bundle_fix.sh`
6. Build your app: `flutter build ios --release`

## For Local Development

For local development, you can integrate the pre-build script into your Xcode project:

1. Open the Runner.xcworkspace in your ios directory
2. Add the `ios_prebuild.sh` script as a "Run Script" build phase
3. Make sure it runs before the "Thin Binary" phase

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Clean your build: `flutter clean`
2. Remove Pods: `cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock && cd ..`
3. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Install pods: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`
5. Run the fix script: `./privacy_bundle_fix.sh`
6. Build again: `flutter build ios --release`
